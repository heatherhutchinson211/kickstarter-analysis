Hello Louise! 
---
I have analzyed all of the data of the Kickstarter Campaigns.---
I have found some important trends in the data given.---
*As far as theater campaigns in the US, it seems that 912 goals, only 525 were successful.  Of that 912, 349 of the goals failed, and 12 are still live.  Below is a chart representing this data. ---

*I have also analyzed the plays specifically in this category.  I have seen that there are 314 total.  Of these, 238 were successful, 70 failed, and 6 are still live.  This can be seen in the graph below. ---

*I also took a look at how these goals did during different times in the year.  It seems that there were the highest percentage of successful plays in the months of May and June, with the lowest being in March and December. ---

Additionally, I did some analysis on the US Plays.  The average successful goal for plays in the US was $5,049, and the average successful amount pledged was $5,602.  On the other hand, The average failed goal for plays in the US was $10,554, and the average amount pledged for these failed goals was $559.  I also did some additional analysis on this set shown below. ---

Finally, I did some similar analyis on this data in Great Brittain, as I know you were interested in that data as well.  I have represented this data in the chart shown below.  ---

Overall, I recommend that you keep the goals around $5,000 as these seem to be the most successful all around.  I also reccommend that you create these goals in the summer months, as these seem to do significantly better than the goals in the colder times of the year.  
I hope this information helps you to increase success in future years.
Thank You.
